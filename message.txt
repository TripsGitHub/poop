“Merry Christmas, Rhein,” the reindeer muttered under his breath as he leapt off the delivery truck. Frustration etched deep into his face, he stomped his way to the back to retrieve the final package of the night. Whoever had concocted the brilliant idea of scheduling Christmas Eve deliveries deserved a close and personal discussion—with his fist.

Of course, there was no one else to blame but himself. This assignment, equal parts punishment and final chance, was his penance for a long history of missed deliveries.

“I have a tight schedule; I can’t wait around for someone to take three minutes to open a damn door,” Rhein grumbled aloud, as if vocalizing his complaint could somehow win the argument brewing in his own mind.

At least the house was lit up, a promising sign of life within. Yet, something about the scene made his fur prickle with unease. A subtle wrongness lingered, just out of reach, but undeniably present.

DING-DONG

Without hesitation, Rhein yanked out one of the stickers he had practically memorized: “Delivery attempted. No one home.” As he turned to leave, his resolve faltered.

“Damn it. What am I doing?” he muttered, spinning back to face the door. He unceremoniously dropped the package on the front step.

“Uh… hello?” Rhein called, peering through one of the small windows inset in the door. “Dasher Express.”

Silence.

Whatever, he thought, shoving the box into a nearby bush. But as he turned to leave, his eyes snagged on a pesky little checkbox on the shipping label:

PROOF OF DELIVERY: SIGNATURE REQUIRED

He let out an audible groan, hoping the sheer force of his displeasure might summon the homeowner to the door. Begrudgingly, Rhein bent down to retrieve the package once more.

“Dasher Express!” he bellowed, punctuating his words with a firm knock on the door.

A sound. Was it a chuckle? A scream? Whatever it was, he definitely heard someone inside the house..

“Oh, hell no. I will deliver this package.”

Taking a few wary steps back, Rhein surveyed the house—his battleground. Built like a fortress, it was a veritable stronghold. Every window was shut tight, every door firmly locked. There wasn’t a single crack in its armor, no carelessly left-open window or conveniently unlocked latch.

But just as hope began to dwindle, something caught his eye—the chimney. A wild, borderline ridiculous idea popped into his head. It was big enough to fit him, wasn’t it?

“I am not losing this job,” Rhein muttered with steely resolve as he marched back to his truck. His gaze darted around, searching for something—anything—that could secure the package to his back.

“Come on, there’s gotta be something. Anything… Aha!” His eyes lit up as he grabbed a massive roll of Christmas ribbon. It was a holiday gift from the company, meant for drivers to decorate packages during the season. Naturally, Rhein hadn’t touched a single inch of the 100-foot roll—until now.

With a grin that bordered on manic, he wrapped the ribbon tightly around his torso and the box, encasing them together in what could only be described as an industrial-strength festive cocoon.

“You’re not going anywhere, buddy.”

Determined, Rhein circled the house until he found a section of wall overgrown with vines. He stopped, staring at them for a full minute as if debating his life choices.

“Screw it,” he muttered, grabbing hold and beginning his ascent.

Reaching the roof, Rhein’s plan crystallized. This package was going to be delivered—and signed for—no matter the cost. He crept toward the chimney, each step on the tiles precarious and deliberate. Upon reaching the edge, he peered down into the sooty abyss. Tentatively, he ran a finger along the interior wall. Black dust clung instantly to his fingertips, smearing like an accusation.

“Is this some kind of cosmic punishment?!” he roared, shaking both fists at the heavens. “FUCK OFF!”

Across the street, a man walking his dog paused, squinting upward at the bizarre spectacle of a shouting reindeer on a roof while undressing himself. “Mind your own business, Robert. No kink-shaming.”

Returning to the task at hand, Rhein groaned as he continued shedding his uniform. His boss had been explicit—one stain, even the smallest smudge, and he’d be fired. The last thing he needed was a soot-covered jacket as evidence of this escapade.

Down to his boxers, Rhein stood at the edge of the chimney, his breath misting in the cold night air. He took one final deep breath, followed by a long, resigned sigh.

“Here goes nothing,” he muttered, gripping the rim of the chimney and lowering himself in.

Not even a full meter into the descent, an awful realization dawned on Rhein—the soot-covered walls were incredibly slick.

“Oh no”. Final words of a man who was about to get hurt.

—

“Give me a second, chat. I think I heard something,” Red announced as he yanked off his headset. Clad in nothing but his usual gaming attire—boxer briefs—he stood and stretched before honing in on the noise. From downstairs came a chorus of groans and muffled curses.

In hindsight, he might have thought twice. But adrenaline surged through his veins, and this tiger wasn’t the type to back down. Fight or flight? He chose the former. Snatching the decorative katana mounted above his PC, Red darted out of his room.

‘I saw this in Bleach,’ he thought to himself as he leapt down the entire staircase in one fluid motion. His claws dug into the carpet upon landing, katana poised dramatically over one shoulder.

“Omae wa mou shindeiru,” he whispered with a grin sharp enough to rival his claws.

But instead of an intruder, Red found himself face-to-face with a rather unconventional sight—a reindeer, bound with Christmas ribbon and rendered completely immobile.

“Hot, naked, buffed man… Holy shit, Santa is real!”

The reindeer flinched. “This isn’t what it looks like! I’m just trying to deliver a pa—wait. Did you just say hot?” The shift in his expression—from panic to intrigue—was so abrupt it caught even him off guard.

Red, still attempting to project menace, leveled his katana at the stranger. “Maybe I did.”

Rhein swallowed hard. Something about this tiger—this slender, confident twink—was unsettling him in ways he hadn’t anticipated. “Not gonna lie,” he muttered, trying to maintain composure. “That entrance was pretty hot too.”

Silence enveloped them as they scrutinized each other, gradually acknowledging the inevitable tension between them. “You wanna fuck?” Rhein, the unintentional provocateur, broke the silence.

Instantly, he realized the recklessness of his suggestion while bound with his hands behind his back. Red advanced toward him, hastily shedding his boxers. Rhein felt an irresistible magnetic pull toward this enigmatic figure and eagerly opened his mouth to receive him.

Red gasped as Rhein deftly took him in, engulfing his length almost entirely. Waves of heat and wetness sent shivers of pleasure coursing through him. He hadn’t anticipated the other to be so eager.

Feeling Red’s arousal intensify within his mouth, growing as hard as stone, Rhein’s own desire surged.

Red withdrew, his member brushing against Rhein’s cheekbone. Rhein’s pleading gaze, filled with longing and anticipation, nearly compelled him to indulge once more. However, Red had other plans. “Do you know what’s in the package you delivered?”

Without awaiting a response, Red moved behind Rhein, unboxing its contents. Rhein strained against his restraints to catch a glimpse, but the bindings restricted his movement. A chill ran over him as his boxers were stripped away. As confusion settled, realization dawned when he recognized the unmistakable sound of a vibrator. “Wa-wait, I’m a top, I d- AAUUUGH,” he stammered when the vibrator was firmly yet gently introduced.

Experiencing penetration for the first time, initial discomfort quickly transformed into pleasure as he relaxed. “F-fuck…” he breathed, savoring every moment and craving more. Red stopped midway, seemingly aware of the tantalizing game he played.

“Beg,” Red murmured into his ear.

“You’ll regret this, you brat,” Rhein warned with defiance.

Red chuckled softly, easing the vibrator out.

“Wait!” Rhein was engulfed by bewilderment, but one thing was clear: the void left him yearning. “Please…”

Red whispered again, relishing his dominance over the larger man. “Please what?”

“Motherfucker…” Rhein relented, his voice a mixture of frustration and desperation, “Please, put it in… All the way.”

A soft, amused chuckle was followed by the newfound sensation of fullness, the vibrator eliciting tingling sensations from within. “Fuck… Yeah…” Rhein managed to utter through moans.

Red circled around him, seating himself on the couch and guiding the reindeer by his antlers to join him.

“Keep this up, and you’ll regr—” Rhein’s words were abruptly cut off as Red pulled his antlers down, thrusting his cock into Rhein’s mouth, the tip brushing his throat.

“Fuck,” Red whispered, gripping the antlers tightly as he thrust hard. A torrent of thoughts raced through his mind: the exquisite sensation of his cock enveloped in Rhein’s hot, wet mouth, the thrill of effortlessly dominating someone twice his size.

“I’m… close…” Red gritted out, his voice strained with impending climax.

Rhein felt the cock twitch within his mouth, driven by an inexplicable need to satisfy the tiger. He moved his head with fervor, intensifying the rhythm until Red exploded, filling his mouth with cum. Rhein eagerly swallowed, ensuring he coaxed out every drop.

Red reclined, arms limp at his sides. “That… was incredible…” he murmured, his eyes fluttering shut.

“We’re not done.”

Red opened his eyes again only to find the reindeer standing in front of him “You could’ve freed yourself all this time?”

“I’m a kinky fucker,” Rhein admitted with a mischievous smile, leaning down to capture Red in a deep kiss, urging him to taste himself, what he had done inside his mouth.

With unsurprising ease, Rhein lifted Red, flaunting his strength and size difference. They resumed their passionate exchange, hands exploring each other’s bodies. Rhein slowly lowered Red onto his cock. “Ah…” a soft moan escaped Red’s lips as Rhein’s head popped inside his ass.

The tiger felt his body stretch with every inch, each movement a deliberate tease as Rhein let gravity guide their joining, only to lift him slightly and thrust down again—a measured pace that hinted at playful retribution.

Soon, Red found himself completely impaled, his arms wrapped around Rhein amidst a passionate kiss. The vibrations from the dildo were strong enough to transmit through Rhein’s cock, an exhilarating sensation he hadn’t anticipated. The shared pleasure from the same source drove both of them wild.

But the reindeer had other intentions. Carrying Red to a table, he nearly dropped him face-down. “Now the fun begins…” he declared with a smug grin. Before Red could process, Rhein withdrew almost entirely only to forcefully thrust back in, a motion that left Red seeing stars.

“AH! FUCK!” Red exclaimed, overwhelmed by sheer pleasure. He craved more, and his desires seemingly resonated with the reindeer.

Slapping sounds could be heard all over the house as hips connected with ass cheeks. Rhein held nothing back, intuitively aware that Red relished it.

“Huh, you like it rough, little brat?” Rhein chuckled, a glimmer of amusement in his eyes. The experience was unlike anything he’d ever had—not only was Red’s ass the best he had ever fucked, he could go as rough and hard as he desired. So he did.

Slap. Slap. Slap. Slap. Slap. Slap. Slap. Slap.

Like a relentless machine, Rhein pounded on, elated by Red’s moans and gasps each time he struck the perfect spot. The symphony of Red’s pleasure, an unexpected delight, was a reward he never thought he could take so much pleasure from. He wanted more, he wanted to hear him moan, to be the one who was responsible for it.

Red’s vision blurred, dark spots danced in his sight. “AH… AH… AH…” he breathed, his body responding on instinct alone. “AH AH AH,” his moans merged with Rhein’s swift thrusts. They were both teetering on the edge.

Rhein leaned down, grabbing Red’s head to hold him in place. He sensed the climax approaching; He could feel it as Red’s body contracted so hard around his cock, he thought he might not be able to pump his load inside him.

They continued like this for a full minute, Rhein expertly controlling both of their climaxes, making sure to edge both as much as he could. But even he could not take it much longer. With slower yet much harder thrusts, he pushed his cock as deep as he could.

Red’s vision darkened completely as he sensed Rhein’s massive cock twitch deep inside him, filling him with wave after wave of cum, each pulse a palpable presence. He could actually feel himself being filled. That sensation pushed Red over, shaking as he came on the table.

In the aftermath, silence settled, broken only by their labored breathing until a single word cut through: “More…”

Rhein glanced down, his expression puzzled, unsure if he’d heard correctly. “What?”

Red turned slightly, locking eyes with the reindeer. “I said more…”

Rhein grinned widely, accepting the challenge. “At your service, brat.” Grabbing Red’s left leg for better leverage, he began anew, thrusting with greater intensity now that the coated insides eased their relentless pace.

Right there, they both knew this was going to be a long night.
